## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'
**Solution:** Install missing dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common missing modules and their fixes:
- `phidata` → `pip install phidata`
- `openai` → `pip install openai`
- `chromadb` → `pip install chromadb`
- `langchain_chroma` → `pip install langchain-chroma`
- `langchain_openai` → `pip install langchain-openai`
- `duckduckgo_search` → `pip install duckduckgo-search`

### "streamlit: command not found"
**Solution:** Use Python module syntax
```bash
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

Or add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### "No API key found" or API errors
**Solution:**
1. Ensure `.env` file exists in the project root
2. Verify your API key is correctly formatted:
   - Groq keys start with `gsk_`
   - OpenAI keys start with `sk-`
3. Check that the key is valid and active
4. For OpenAI: Ensure you have credits in your account

### "Failed to load document" (RAG feature)
**Solution:**
- Ensure PDF is not password-protected
- Check file is not corrupted
- Try converting to text format first
- Verify file size is reasonable (< 50MB recommended)

### "Agent not responding" or timeout errors
**Solution:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API key is valid and active
- Try switching to a different model in the app settings
- For Groq: Check [status.groq.com](https://status.groq.com)
- For OpenAI: Check [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)

### ChromaDB errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete the vector database and restart
rm -rf chroma_db/
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```

Ensure you have write permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 755 .
```

### Port already in use (Address already in use)
**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill existing Streamlit processes
pkill -f streamlit

# Or use a different port
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```
